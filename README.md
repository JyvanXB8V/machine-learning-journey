# ðŸ§  My Machine Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal repository where I document everything I learn on my journey into **Machine Learning**. This includes theory notes, code implementations, Jupyter notebooks, small projects, and resources I find useful.

## ðŸ“š About

I'm currently teaching myself machine learning using online resources, books, and hands-on experimentation. This repo is a central place to:

- Track my progress
- Share my learning
- Store my code and notes
- Build a portfolio of mini-projects
